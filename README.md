# asC
A toy for practicing my knowledge about compilers.

# And ...
The language itself can assign new value of string,integer,declare new function,call functions with parameters,use the If,While control flow.Simple but  Turing-complete ...I think?

# OK I mean...
The little compiler can just produce AST from the source and translate it into Javascript cause it's written in Node.js, and has poor error catching. However don't demand too much!
